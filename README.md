Off-policy learning in robotics simulation with Fetch mobile manipulator.

In robotics, physics-based simulations are crucial for training real-life robots. Simulations have seen adoption accelerated by the rapid growth in computational power over the last three decades (Liu & Negrut, 2021). Robots are very complicated systems, training them in the real world can be challenging, since execution and feedback is slow. Physics-based simulation allows sampling experience millions times faster than in the real world, making it possible to train very complicated robots. 

In this project, we apply Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning methods to Fetch Mobile Manipulator, a 7-DoF arm with a two-fingered parallel gripper attached to it. We train the Fetch robot to solve tasks such as Reach, Push, Slide or Pick and Place.
